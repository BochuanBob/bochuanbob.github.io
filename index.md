I will soon join SAS Institute as an operations research specialist working on optimization solvers, such as LP/MILP solvers. I received my M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of [Computational Applied Mathematics and Operations Research](https://cmor.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) in 2022 and 2023 respectively, working with [Joey Huchette](https://www.joehuchette.com/) at Google Research and [Illya V. Hicks](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/illya-v-hicks). Before Rice, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/) in 2019, working with [Megan Heyman](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/academics/faculty/heyman-megan-heyman.html) and [Allen Holder](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/academics/faculty/holder-allen-holder.html).

I am primarily interested in mathematical optimization with a concentration on mixed-integer programming and combinatorial optimization. My Ph.D. study is focused on modeling disjunctive constraints under the independent branching scheme.
