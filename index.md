I will soon join SAS Institute as an operations research specialist working on optimization solvers, such as LP/MILP solvers. I received my master and Ph.D. from the Department of [Computational Applied Mathematics and Operations Research](https://cmor.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) in 2022 and 2023 respectively, working with [Joey Huchette](https://www.joehuchette.com/) at Google Research and [Illya V. Hicks](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/illya-v-hicks). Before Rice, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/) in 2019.

I am interested in optimization with a concentration on mixed-integer programming and combinatorial optimization. My Ph.D. study is focus on modeling disjunctive constraints under independent branching scheme.
